# PoE GET - Gem Exploration Tool

A small tool to search Path of Exile skills based on the tags they bear, including custom tags. Now includes a GUI via JavaFX, but it is by no means fancy
since this is my first time I created a GUI.

The Weapon tags mean the following:
	ANY - will display all attacks that you can use with any weapon
	Two Handed - will display all attacks that you can use with any two handed weapon
	Dual Wield - will display all attacks that you can use while dual wielding
	
If you have an idea on which custom tags might be useful, find any skills with the wrong tags or have
any suggestions on an additional feature please contact me, if it is a good idea I will try and implement it.
Any Feedback you have is also welcome.
	
All the information about the skills is taken from http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Path_of_Exile_Wiki .
